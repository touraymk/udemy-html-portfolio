      <h3>Vikings</h3>
      <p>
        As a Norwegian, I love love love series about vikings. Even thought it
        displays many different historical persons into one person, if you know
        youâ€™re history it can be hard to watch at times. It got everything
        action, love, tragedy and to some point it might depict what life was
        like.

      <h3>Griselda</h3>
      <p>
        I loved the story about Griselda Blanco, not to glorify the drug
        business but because it's really fascinating that a woman with really
        bad cards dealt makes it in an exlucivly male dominated occupation.
      </p>
      <h3>The Crime of the Centuries</h3>
      <p>
        I like this show because I think its important to shine light on these
        problems where the victim is placed at fault by the legal system/
        society.
